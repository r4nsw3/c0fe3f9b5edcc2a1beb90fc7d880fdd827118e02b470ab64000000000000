  |   The year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from    |
  |   your messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming              |
  |   wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it's your job to look for   |
  |   smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer     |
  |   has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a woman named Delilah, is      |
  |   available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio-your       |
  |   only contact with the world you've left behind. But when something    |
  |   strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the world,       |
  |   you'll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and   |
  |   making choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful          |
  |   relationship you have.                                                |
